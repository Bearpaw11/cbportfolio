          As a seasoned developer, I bring a unique blend of critical thinking, teamwork, experience working in an agile environment, and a passion for challenges. Armed with a Full Stack Web Development certificate from The University of Arizona and TEKsystems, my skill set encompasses Java, Spring Boot, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, MySQL, Postgres, and Snowflake.

          I have experience working as a software developer at Deloitte, contributing to a project for the IRS where I created and maintained API endpoints for seamless communication among microservices. During my tenure at United Health Group, I played a key role in developing and maintaining our BCP mirroring program, responsible for mirroring over 50 billion rows of data from our on-prem SQL Server to Snowflake. Additionally, my role as a Systems Engineer at TD Synnex has equipped me with knowledge of cutting-edge hardware and software, fostering growth and the implementation of new technologies in this space. Complementing my technical expertise is a strong business background, highlighted by a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Finance, which enables me to provide a monetary perspective on projects.
