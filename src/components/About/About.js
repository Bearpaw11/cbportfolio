          My experience as a Systems Engineer has given me knowledge of the cutting edge hardware and software being used to accelerate growth and new technologies in this space. I also have a strong business background that includes a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Finance that can be used to put a monetary perspective on projects. I am excited to leverage my expertise, education and knowledge to become an asset to a software development team.
